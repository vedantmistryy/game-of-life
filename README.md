## Conway's Game of Life

This is a web version of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. The Game of Life follows a set of simple rules to simulate the behavior of cells in a grid, creating fascinating patterns and evolving structures.

## How to Play

1. Access the game through the provided web URL or host it locally on your machine.
2. The game starts with an initial configuration of cells on a grid.
3. Observe the evolution of the cells based on the following rules:
    - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
    - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
4. Click on the grid cells to toggle them between alive and dead states.
5. You can pause and resume the game at any time to analyze the current state.
6. Explore different initial configurations and observe the patterns that emerge over time.
   
## Features

- Interactive grid: Click on cells to toggle their state.
- Pause and resume: Control the simulation to observe specific patterns or configurations.
- Random configuration: Generate a random initial configuration of cells.
- Clear grid: Reset the grid to an empty state.
- Speed control: Adjust the speed of the simulation to observe changes at different rates.
  
## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3: Structuring and styling the web page.
- JavaScript: Implementing the game logic and interactivity.
- Canvas API: Rendering the grid and cell states.
- Event listeners: Capturing user input and updating the game state.
- SetInterval: Controlling the simulation speed.
