# Game of Life

## Description

**Conway's Game of Life web version!**  
This is a zero-player game, that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input.  
One interacts with the game of life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.  
It is turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other turing machine.  
I hope this repository is a good lab for game of life.  
And I also hope this repository is a [good starting point](https://github.com/TroyTae/game-of-life/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) for first-time contributors.
